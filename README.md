# GATE OF SHELL

**SIMPLE SHELL**
A shell is the top level layer of the Unix system.

To put it simply, a shell is a program that takes a command as input, parses it, and executes it.

We will divide the work into several parts:

# Loop back user input
# Parse user input
# Execute the command
# Code the builtins
# Environnment management

**Directions for Use**
Compile with this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

Invoke shell by typing its path name

$ ./a.out
hedy_cherif&>i
